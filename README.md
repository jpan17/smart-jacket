# Smart Jacket: A Wearable Electronics Project

## MVP ## 
- Speed Display Mode: Accelerometer in the phone detects how fast the user is traveling and the NeoPixels will blink at varying rates in response
- Focus Mode: If the user's phone is moving or face-up during focus mode, lights will alert the user to put it down
- Weather Mode: The display will change depending on the weather condition at the user's location
- Scavenger Hunt: Given a destination, the display will change as the user gets closer to that destination
